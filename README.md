# Information Visualization

This CS5346 class at NUS Singapore aimed to bring together individual pedagogies of design, information, and computation, for teaching the analysis and representation of data for visualisation. It dealt with the methodology of developing and evaluating an information visualisation solution, common information visualisation techniques (such as those for topical, spatial, hierarchical, temporal, and relational data), and methods for scaling up interactive visualisation with big data. 

As of technologies, I mostly used D3 and Tableau. 

## Group Project
In order to understand the factors that contribute to one’s lifespan, one needs to look for patterns and indicators of correlation in a population in addition to analyzing the human body biologically. For our group project, we created visuzalizations and a poster to introduce readers to several potential factors that may impact life expectancy.

We have considered four factors: Obesity, Smoking and Substance Abuse, Food Habits and Employment. We attempt to introduce some attributes of these factors and their association with life expectancy. The interactive project can be explored here<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>.

## Assignment 1

In this assignment I created visualizations from a dataset containing information about the efficiency of video streaming methods. I used D3 to create it. 

## Assignment 2

I used a dataset from MakeOverMonday (https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk) about the bicycle Industry in the UK and created a visuzalization using Tableau. The interactive workfile is available to explore here<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>.

## Assignment 3

The aim of this project was to create interesting visualizations with Tableau about a large dataset containing research papers. The data comes from Semantic Scholar, a free, nonproﬁt, academic search engine. It contains a large amount of research papers (as of May 2018), together with attributes such as the paper title, the author-and co-authors and the number of citations. For my work, I extracted 200’000 papers from the full 39 Million available. The interactive project is available to explore here<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>.

## Assignment 4

The objective of this assignment was to create visualizations about a dataset created by the National Environment Agency (NEA), which lists licensed eating establishments in Singapore in 2015, together with metrics such as a health grade, demerit points and suspension history. The visualizations would help to answer analytical questions about this subject.

## Assignment 5

In a Group Project, we wrote and presented a paper about Force-Directed Graphs.
